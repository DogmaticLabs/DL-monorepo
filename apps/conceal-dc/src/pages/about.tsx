              <p className='text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed'>
                At Conceal DC, we understand the frustration of long waiting periods for concealed
                carry license appointments. Our mission is to help reduce these wait times by
                alerting you when earlier appointment slots become available due to cancellations,
                allowing you to potentially advance your application timeline by weeks or months.

              <p className='text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4'>
                Our service actively monitors the DC Metropolitan Police Department&apos;s
                appointment system for concealed carry license applications. When someone cancels or
                reschedules their appointment, we immediately notify our users who are looking to
                secure an earlier date.
              </p>
              <p className='text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed'>
                By catching these cancellations in real-time, we help ensure that available
                appointments don&apos;t go unnoticed, potentially reducing your wait time
                significantly.
